# This sets the dashed pattern for lines and curves. The (dash) length defines
# how long each dash will be.
#
# The <code>:space</code> option defines the length of the space between the
# dashes.
#
# The <code>:phase</code> option defines the start point of the sequence of
# dashes and spaces.
#
# Complex dash patterns can be specified by using an array with alternating
# dash/gap lengths for the first parameter (note that the <code>:space</code>
# option is ignored in this case).
