# The cap style defines how the edge of a line or curve will be drawn. There are
# three types: <code>:butt</code> (the default), <code>:round</code> and
# <code>:projecting_square</code>
#
# The difference is better seen with thicker lines. With <code>:butt</code> lines
# are drawn starting and ending at the exact points provided. With both
# <code>:round</code> and <code>:projecting_square</code> the line is projected
# beyond the start and end points.
#
# Just like <code>line_width=</code> the <code>cap_style=</code> method needs an explicit receiver to
# work.
