# There are five kinds of objects which can be put in table cells:
#   1. String: produces a text cell (the most common usage)
#   2. <code>Prawn::Table::Cell</code>
#   3. <code>Prawn::Table</code>
#   4. Array
#   5. Images
#
# Whenever a table or an array is provided as a cell, a subtable will be created
# (a table within a cell).
#
# If you'd like to provide a cell or table directly, the best way is to
# use the <code>make_cell</code> and <code>make_table</code> methods as they
# don't call <code>draw</code> on the created object.
#
# To insert an image just provide a hash with an with an <code>:image</code> key
# pointing to the image path.
