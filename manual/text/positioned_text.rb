# Sometimes we want the text on a specific position on the page. The
# <code>text</code> method just won't help us.
#
# There are two other methods for this task: <code>draw_text</code> and
# <code>text_box</code>.
#
# <code>draw_text</code> is very simple. It will render text starting at the
# position provided to the <code>:at</code> option. It won't flow to a new line
# even if it hits the document boundaries so it is best suited for short text.
#
# <code>text_box</code> gives us much more control over the output. Just provide
# <code>:width</code> and <code>:height</code> options and the text will flow
# accordingly. Even if you don't provide a <code>:width</code> option the text
# will flow to a new line if it reaches the right border.
#
# Given that said, <code>text_box</code> is the better option available.
#

  text_box "This is a text box, you can control where it will flow by " +
           "specifying the :height and :width options",
           :at => [100, 250],
           :height => 100,
           :width => 100
  
  text_box "Another text box with no :width option passed, so it will " +
