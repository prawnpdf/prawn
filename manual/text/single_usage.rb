# The PDF format has some built-in font support. If you want to use other fonts
# in Prawn you need to embed the font file.
#
# Doing this for a single font is extremely simple. Remember the Styling font
# example? Another use of the <code>font</code> method is to provide a font file
# path and the font will be embedded in the document and set as the current
# font.
#
# This is reasonable if a font is used only once, but, if a font used several
# times, providing the path each time it is used becomes cumbersome. The example
# on the next page shows a better way to deal with fonts which are used several
# times in a document.
