# Text rendering can be as simple or as complex as you want.
#
# This example covers the most basic method: <code>text</code>. It is meant for
# free flowing text. The provided string will flow according to the current
# bounding box width and height. It will also flow onto the next page if the
# bottom of the bounding box is reached.
#
# The text will start being rendered on the current cursor position. When it
# finishes rendering, the cursor is left directly below the text.
#
# This example also shows text flowing across pages following the margin box and
# other bounding boxes.
