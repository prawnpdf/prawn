# Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a
# proportional font. It is usually done with specific letter pairs. We can
# switch it on and off if it is available with the current font. Just pass a
# boolean value to the <code>:kerning</code> option of the text methods.
#
# Character Spacing is the space between characters. It can be increased or
# decreased and will have effect on the whole text. Just pass a number to the
# <code>:character_spacing</code> option from the text methods.
