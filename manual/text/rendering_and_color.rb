# You have already seen how to set the text color using both inline formatting
# and the format text methods. There is another way by using the graphics
# methods <code>fill_color</code> and <code>stroke_color</code>.
#
# When reading the graphics reference you learned about fill and stroke. If you
# haven't read it before, read it now before continuing.
#
# Text can be rendered by
# being filled (the default mode) or just stroked or both filled and stroked.
# This can be set using the <code>text_rendering_mode</code> method or the
# <code>:mode</code> option on the text methods.
