# One of the options that the <code>image</code> method accepts is

# probably already familiar with it. Just provide it the upper-left corner where
# you want the image placed.
#
# While sometimes useful this option won't be practical. Notice that the cursor
# won't be moved after the image is rendered and there is nothing forbidding the
# text to overlap with the image.
