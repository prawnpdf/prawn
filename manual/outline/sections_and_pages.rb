# The document outline tree is the set of links used to navigate through the
# various document sections and pages.
#
# To define the document outline we first use the <code>outline</code>
# method to lazily instantiate an outline object. Then we use the
# <code>define</code> method with a block to start the outline tree.
#
# The basic methods for creating outline nodes are <code>section</code> and
# <code>page</code>. The only difference between the two is that
# <code>page</code> doesn't accept a block and will only create leaf nodes
# while <code>section</code> accepts a block to create nested nodes.
#
# <code>section</code> accepts the title of the section and two options:
# <code>:destination</code> - a page number to link and <code>:closed</code> -
# a boolean value that defines if the nested outline nodes are shown when the
# document is open (defaults to true).
#
# <code>page</code> is very similar to section. It requires a
# <code>:title</code> option to be set and accepts a <code>:destination</code>.
#
# <code>section</code> and <code>page</code> may also be used without the
# <code>define</code> method but they will need to instantiate the
# <code>outline</code> object every time.
