# We have already seen how to define an outline tree sequentially.
#
# If you'd like to add nodes to the middle of an outline tree the
# <code>add_subsection_to</code> may help you.
#
# It allows you to insert sections to the outline tree at any point. Just
# provide the <code>title</code> of the parent section, the
# <code>position</code> you want the new subsection to be inserted
# <code>:first</code> or <code>:last</code> (defaults to <code>:last</code>)
# and a block to declare the subsection.
#
# The <code>add_subsection_to</code> block doesn't necessarily create new
# sections, it may also create new pages.
#
# If the parent title provided is the title of a page. The page will be
# converted into a section to receive the subsection created.
