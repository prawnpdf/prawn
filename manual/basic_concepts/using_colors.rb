# There are generally two colors (or pens) that are active at any
# given time: the <i>stroke-color</i> which is used for drawing
# lines, and the <i>fill-color</i> which is used to paint in areas as
# well as drawing text.
#
# There are several ways that these colors may be set: whether
# directly with the <code>stroke_color</code> and
# <code>fill_color</code> methods; passed as options to other
# rendering functions; or even inside of text with HTML-like
# inline markup.
