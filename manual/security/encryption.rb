# The <code>encrypt_document</code> method, as you might have already guessed,
# is used to encrypt the PDF document.
#
# Once encrypted whoever is using the document will need the user password to
# read the document. This password can be set with the
# <code>:user_password</code> option. If this is not set the document will be
# encrypted but a password will not be needed to read the document.
#
# There are some caveats when encrypting your PDFs. Be sure to read the source
# documentation (you can find it here:
# https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/blob/master/lib/prawn/security.rb ) before
# using this for anything super serious.
