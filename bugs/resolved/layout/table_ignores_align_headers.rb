# As of fadb65c303ff129d0b25a929d3b9d1f915b2f98d,
# Prawn ignores :align_headers property in tables
# when :border_style => :grid is present (Lighthouse issue #119).
#
# NOTES: 
# 
#  * This issue can only be reproduced when :border_style => :grid is used
#
# Resolved as of 47297900dcf3f16c4765ca817f17c53fb0a5a079
# I think a bad merge created issues in edge, and this code fixes previous
# problems that are present in stable.
