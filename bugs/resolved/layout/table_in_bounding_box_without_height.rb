# Issue with tables within stretchy bounding boxes.  Changes to the way
# bounding boxes work caused tables to not properly render within stretchy
# bounding boxes.  
#
# A fix in 200fc36455fa3bee0e1e3bb25d1b5bf73dbf3b52 makes it so the bottom
# of the margin_box will be used as the page boundary in stretchy bounding 
# boxes.  Ideally, this would instead use the nesting bounding box dimensions
# [#80] , but this works for now.
