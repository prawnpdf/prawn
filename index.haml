            Generating printable documents can be ridiculously hard, but it doesn't have to be.  
            What we really need is not another special purpose application or kitchen-sink library, 
            but a hackable platform instead.
          %p
            Prawn provides a super high level API for sorts of things that everyone implementing 
            printable documents will need, making it easy to produce basic documents.  
            That said, Prawn's low level features are what makes it unique. 
          %p
            Just beneath the surface, you'll find a comprehensive extension API 
            that lets you leverage the full range of possibilities that the robust PDF format 
            affords you.  We also expose every bit of tooling that we've used to implement 
            Prawn's core functionality, all of which you can add to or change in any way 
            you'd like.  This makes it possible to share your new features with others,
            without having to receive our "blessings" first.

            %p Getting started with Prawn can be as simple as:
            %p
              require 'prawn'
              %br
              Prawn::Document.generate('hello.pdf') do |pdf|
              %br
              &nbsp;&nbsp;pdf.text("Hello Prawn!")
              %br
              end
            %p

            Our goal is to bring the sort of modularity and aggressive code re-use 
            found in web development to the printable document problem space.
