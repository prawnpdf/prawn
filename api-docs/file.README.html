<p>Prawn is a pure Ruby PDF generation library that provides a lot of great
functionality while trying to remain simple and reasonably performant. Here
are some of the important features we provide:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Vector drawing support, including lines, polygons, curves, ellipses, etc.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Extensive text rendering support, including flowing text and limited inline
formatting options.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Support for both PDF builtin fonts as well as embedded TrueType fonts</p>
</li><li>
<p>A variety of low level tools for basic layout needs, including a simple
grid system</p>
</li><li>
<p>PNG and JPG image embedding, with flexible scaling options</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reporting tools for rendering complex data tables, with pagination support</p>
</li><li>
<p>Security features including encryption and password protection</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tools for rendering repeatable content (i.e headers, footers, and page
numbers)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Comprehensive internationalization features, including full support for
UTF-8 based fonts, right-to-left text rendering, fallback font support, and
extension points for customizable text wrapping.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Support for PDF outlines for document navigation</p>
</li><li>
<p>Low level PDF features, allowing users to create custom extensions by
dropping down all the way to the PDF object tree layer. (Mostly useful to
those with knowledge of the PDF specification)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Lots of other stuff!</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Should+You+Use+Prawn%3F">Should You Use Prawn?</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a highly flexible PDF document generation system,
Prawn might be the tool for you. It is not a reporting tool or a publishing
toolchain, though it could be fairly easily used to build those things.</p>

<p>One thing Prawn is not, and will never be, is an HTML to PDF generator. For
those needs, consider looking into FlyingSaucer via JRuby, or one of the
webkit based tools, like Wicked or PDFKit. We do have basic support for
inline styling but it is limited to a very small subset of functionality
and is not suitable for rendering rich HTML documents.</p>

<h2 id="label-Supported+Ruby+Versions+and+Implementations">Supported Ruby Versions and Implementations</h2>

<p>Because Prawn is pure Ruby and virtually all of its dependencies are
maintained by our core team, it should run pretty much anywhere, including
Rubinius, JRuby, MacRuby, etc. We officially support MRI 2.0.0,
2.1.0 and jruby 1.7.x (&gt;= 1.7.9) in 1.9 mode, however we will accept
patches to fix problems on other Ruby platforms if they aren&#39;t too
invasive.</p>

<h2 id="label-Installing+Prawn">Installing Prawn</h2>

<p>Prawn is distributed via RubyGems, and can be installed the usual way that
you install gems: by simply typing <code>gem install prawn</code> on the
command line.</p>

<p>You can also install from git if you&#39;d like, the <em>master</em> branch
contains the latest developments, and <em>stable</em> represents the latest
bug fixes to the currently released version of Prawn. If you go this route,
using Bundler is encouraged.</p>

<h2 id="label-Release+Policies">Release Policies</h2>

<p>We may introduce backwards incompatible changes each time our minor version
number is bumped, but that any tiny version number bump should be bug fixes
and internal changes only. Be sure to read the release notes each time we
cut a new release and lock your gems accordingly. You can find the project
CHANGELOG at: <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/wiki/CHANGELOG">github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/wiki/CHANGELOG</a></p>

<h2 id="label-Hello+World%21">Hello World!</h2>

<p>If the following code runs and produces a working PDF file, you&#39;ve
successfully installed Prawn.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>prawn</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span>

<span class='const'>Prawn</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Document</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_generate'>generate</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>hello.pdf</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>do</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_text'>text</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>Hello World!</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span>
<span class='kw'>end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you&#39;ll probably want to do more interesting things than
that…</p>

<h2 id="label-Manual">Manual</h2>

<p>Felipe Doria provided us with a beautiful system for generating a user
manual from our examples. This can be generated from the prawn source or
you can download a pre-generated snapshot of it at <a
href="http://prawnpdf.org/manual.pdf">prawnpdf.org/manual.pdf</a></p>

<p>Note that while we will try to keep the downloadable manual up to date,
that it&#39;s provided as a convenience only and you should generate the
manual yourself if you want to be sure the code in it actually runs and
works as expected. To build the manual, here&#39;s what you need to do:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>clone the repository</p>
</li><li>
<p>switch to the stable branch (optional, stay on master for development
version)</p>
</li><li>
<p>install bundler if necessay</p>
</li><li>
<p>run <code>bundle install</code></p>
</li><li>
<p>run <code>bundle exec rake manual</code>, which will generate
<em>manual.pdf</em> in the project root</p>
</li></ol>

<h2 id="label-Support">Support</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get help with Prawn is to post a message to our mailing
list:</p>

<p><a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/prawn-ruby">groups.google.com/group/prawn-ruby</a></p>

<p>Feel free to post any Prawn related question there, our community is very
responsive and will be happy to help you figure out how to use Prawn, or
help you determine whether it&#39;s the right tool for the task you are
working on.</p>

<p>Please make your posts to the list as specific as possible, including code
samples and output where relevant. Do not post any information that should
not be shared publicly, and be sure to reduce your example code as much as
possible so that those who are responding to your question can more easily
see what the issue might be.</p>

<h2 id="label-Contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>If you&#39;ve found a bug, want to submit a patch, or have a feature
request, please enter a ticket into our github tracker:</p>

<p><a
href="http://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues">github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues</a></p>

<p>We strongly encourage bug reports to come with failing tests or at least a
reduced example that demonstrates the problem. Similarly, patches should
include tests, API documentation, and an update to the manual where
relevant. Feel free to send a pull request early though, if you just want
some feedback or a code review before preparing your code to be merged.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about whether or not you&#39;ve found a bug, or want to
check to see whether we&#39;d be interested in the feature you want to add
before you start working on it, feel free to post to our mailing list.</p>

<p>You can run our test suite in a few different ways:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Running <code>rake</code> will run the entire test suite excluding any
unresolved issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Running <code>rspec</code> will run the entire test suite including
unresolved issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Running <code>rspec -t unresolved</code> will run <em>only</em> unresolved
issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Running <code>rspec -t issue:NUMBER</code> will run the tests for a
specific issue</p>
</li></ol>

<p>These filters make it possible for us to add failing test cases for bugs
that are currently being researched or worked on, without breaking the
typical full suite run.</p>

<h2 id="label-Authorship">Authorship</h2>

<p>Prawn was originally developed by Gregory Brown, under the auspices of the
Ruby Mendicant Project, a grassroots initiative in which the Ruby community
collectively provided funding so that Gregory could take several months off
of work to focus on this project.</p>

<p>Over the last several years, we&#39;ve received code contributions from
over 50 people, which is amazing considering the low-level nature of this
project. In 2010, Gregory officially handed the project off to the Prawn
core team. Currently active maintainers include Brad Ediger, Daniel Nelson,
James Healy, and Jonathan Greenberg.</p>

<p>While he was only with us for a short time before moving on to other
things, we&#39;d also like to thank Prawn core team emeritus Jamis Buck for
his contributions. He was responsible for introducing font subsetting as
well as the first implementation of our inline formatting support.</p>

<p>You can find the full list of folks who have at least one patch accepted to
Prawn on github at <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/contributors">github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/contributors</a></p>
