All contributors must agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

1. Bug reports are welcome, but please make sure to include a minimal code sample that
shows your problem. In most cases, we'll need you to give us an example that we
can actually run, so include any necessary sample data. A screenshot 
or stack trace can also be helpful!

2. For all support requests and feature requests, please use the [Prawn mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prawn-ruby) instead of the Github tracker,
or see if anyone is around in #prawn on Freenode to discuss your issue. If we
find that you discovered a bug, or that your feature request is one that
we want to continue to research and discuss on Github, we'll either ask you 
to file a ticket or file one on your behalf. 

3. Pull requests for bug fixes or enhancements are welcome. Feel free to open
them in the early stages of your work so that we can give feedback
and discuss ideas together.
